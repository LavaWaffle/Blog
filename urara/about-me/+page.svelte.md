### Who am I?

I'm Anand Parab, an engineer, learner, biker and boba enjoyer. I love learning about mathematics and physics. After my physics class I've especially taken intrest in electricity and magnestism. In my free time I enjoy cycling through the forest in order to detress. Lastly, call me basic but, I love brown sugar boba milk tea with extra boba.

### My Engineering Experience Summarized

Throughout my highschool years I participated in my schools Robotics team, SPIKE 293. There I focused on programming the robot and learned how to code complex autonomous paths and make simple control schemes for the driver. Additionally, I participated in science olympiad, creating wooden mouse trap cars, bridges, and towers! Finally my senior year I used that experience to create and program completely autonomous soccer robots.

### The future

Currently, I'm a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Here I'm currently in the Engineering Undeclared program, but I hope to graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering. I'm looking forward to making new friends, building awesome things, and developing my skills.
